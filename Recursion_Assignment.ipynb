    "Explanation:-\n",
    "\n",
    "code defines a recursive function called tower_of_hanoi. The function takes four parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "n: the number of disks to move.\n",
    "source: the rod from which to move the disks.\n",
    "target: the rod to which to move the disks.\n",
    "auxiliary: the auxiliary (or spare) rod to facilitate the movement.\n",
    "Now, let's understand how the function works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Base Case (n == 1):\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is only one disk (n == 1), the function prints a statement indicating the movement of the disk from the source rod to the target rod.\n",
    "This is the base case for the recursion.\n",
    "Recursive Steps (n > 1):\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are more than one disk (n > 1), the function does the following:\n",
    "Recursively calls itself with n - 1 disks, moving them from the source rod to the auxiliary rod.\n",
    "Prints a statement indicating the movement of the remaining disk (n) from the source rod to the target rod.\n",
    "Recursively calls itself again with n - 1 disks, moving them from the auxiliary rod to the target rod.\n",
    "The main block of the code sets up the initial parameters and calls the tower_of_hanoi function to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "his block initializes the number of disks (num_disks) and the labels for the source, target, and auxiliary rods. It then prints a message indicating that it's solving the Tower of Hanoi problem and calls the tower_of_hanoi function with the provided parameters. The recursive nature of the function takes care of the step-by-step movements of the disks, and the print statements show the solution.\n"
